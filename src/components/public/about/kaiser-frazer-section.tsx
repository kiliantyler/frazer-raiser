      <p>
        Kaiser-Frazer was one of the few serious post-war challengers to the Big Three. Industrialist Henry J. Kaiser
        teamed up with auto executive Joseph W. Frazer in 1945 to build cars in a converted WWII bomber factory at
        Willow Run, Michigan. The Frazer was positioned as the upmarket companion to the more affordable Kaiser, sharing
        the same body shell but with a more refined feel.
