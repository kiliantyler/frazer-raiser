      <p>
        Kaiser-Frazer was one of the few serious post-war challengers to the Big Three. Industrialist Henry J. Kaiser
        teamed up with auto executive Joseph W. Frazer in 1945 to form the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation, building cars in a
        converted WWII bomber factory at Willow Run, Michigan.

          Frazer positioned as the upmarket companion to the more affordable Kaiser, sharing the same body shell but
