        After twenty years in a barn, this Frazer was gifted to me with an implied promise to restore it and get it
        running again. This project is my way of honoring that promise and preserving a meaningful piece of automotive
        history. Here I&apos;m documenting what&apos;s been rebuilt, what&apos;s been discovered, and what&apos;s still
        stubbornly stuck.
