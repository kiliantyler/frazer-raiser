        My Frazer spent roughly twenty years tucked away in a barn, originally a project car belonging to a
        friend&apos;s father who never got the chance to dig into it. When it was gifted to me, it came with an implied
        promise: restore it to its former glory and get it moving under its own power again.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is my way of honoring that promise and preserving a small but meaningful piece of automotive
        history. Here I&apos;m documenting what&apos;s been rebuilt, what&apos;s been fabricated, what&apos;s been
        discovered about the car along the way, and what&apos;s still stubbornly stuck. If you&apos;re into old metal,
        incremental progress, and bringing overlooked machines back into use, you&apos;re in the right place.
