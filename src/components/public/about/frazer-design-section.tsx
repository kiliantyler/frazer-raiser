      <p>
        The 1948 Frazer was a full-size sedan riding on a wheelbase of around 115 inches and weighing just over 3,300
        pounds. Designed by Howard &quot;Dutch&quot; Darrin, it was recognized for its clean, modern lines and even
        picked up a New York design award.

        Inside, the car offered a roomy six-passenger interior and a large trunk, prioritizing comfort and practicality
        for families and travelers. A small but memorable luxury touch was the use of push-button door openers on all
        four doors, something that was rare in the late 1940s and still feels like a delightfully odd detail today.
