      <p>
        Designed by Howard &quot;Dutch&quot; Darrin, the 1948 Frazer featured clean modern lines that earned a New York
        design award. The full-size sedan offered a roomy six-passenger interior with a large trunk, prioritizing
        comfort and practicality. One memorable detail was the push-button door openers on all four doors, a rare luxury
        in the late 1940s.
