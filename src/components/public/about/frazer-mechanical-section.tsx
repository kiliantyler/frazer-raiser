        The Frazer was mechanically straightforward and durable. It featured a Continental-built 226.2 cubic inch L-head
        inline-six producing roughly 100 horsepower, paired with a Borg-Warner 3-speed manual transmission with
        overdrive. Independent coil springs up front, leaf springs at the rear, and hydraulic drum brakes on all four
        wheels kept things simple. Tuned for comfort rather than speed, it was designed as an easygoing long distance
        car.
