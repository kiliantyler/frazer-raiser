        Mechanically, the Frazer was straightforward and durable, which is part of what makes it restorable today. In
        broad strokes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Continental-built 226.2 cubic inch L-head inline-six producing roughly 100 horsepower in early form</li>
        <li>Borg-Warner 3-speed manual transmission with overdrive for more relaxed highway cruising</li>
        <li>
          Independent coil springs up front, leaf springs at the rear, and hydraulic drum brakes on all four wheels
        </li>
        <li>
          Tuned for comfort and predictability rather than outright speed, making it an easygoing long distance car
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
  )
